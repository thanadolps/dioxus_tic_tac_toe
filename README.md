# Dioxus tic-tac-toe
React's tic tac toe but it's actually dioxus.

According to their webpage: "[Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) is a React-like library for building fast, portable, and beautiful user interfaces with Rust". 
I was curious about how React-like it's, so I try redoing the [React's tic tac toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) but in dioxus, keeping the code as close as possible to the original version.
